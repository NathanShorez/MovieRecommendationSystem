# MovieRecommendationSystem
This a project that has been created to be presented at the AI Club at SDSU.

2 Databases have been merged into a single list, which is then utilzied to determine the simliarity of movies from keywords: overview, genres, cast, and director. A movie title is then passed into the recommend function to display other movie that are determined to be similar to the one provided.

Imported libraries include numpy, pandas, ast, and sci-kit learn.
